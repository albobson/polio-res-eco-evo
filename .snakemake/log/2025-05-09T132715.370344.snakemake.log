MissingOutputException in rule sfig6A in file C:\Users\meowy\OneDrive\Documents\PhD\dominant_drug_targets\pipeline\Snakefile, line 1115:
Job 37  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
runs/ddt_logistic_mu_2e-05_2025-03-24/res/sup/sfig6/A.rds
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
